# deco.cx standard blocks library

This repo contains all the [Live.ts](https://github.com/deco-cx/live.ts) blocks built by the community that are officially maintained by the [deco.cx](https://deco.cx) team.

## How we deal with breaking changes

We are committed to avoiding breaking changes at all costs. The product is still early, but nonetheless we prefer to **add** new blocks or new properties whenever possible.

If and when breaking changes occur, they will be signaled with a new Major version on the git tags.
